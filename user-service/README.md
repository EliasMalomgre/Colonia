This project houses all identity related logic: registering, logging in, storing and hashing passwords.

## Project usage
The project should work as expected by just running it.

### Warning
There is a known bug in early versions of java 11 with TLS 1.3, this produces a handshake exception with the mongoDB database.
We recommend running the project on java version 11.0.9, earlier versions will likely break the application or produce unexpected errors.
